## Course Description
Are you prepared to deepen your knowledge of large-scale computational modeling and pioneer new frontiers in social scientific research? This course will introduce fundamental data mining techniques for extracting insights from massive datasets, as well as the practical and theoretical implications of using these approaches to produce new knowledge about the social and cultural world. For instance, students will learn strategies for deciphering cultural logics at scale (e.g. association rule and frequent itemsets mining), revealing patterns in complex social networks (e.g. link analysis and graph neural networks), and discovering large-scale processes that shape our social and cultural world (e.g. recommender systems and causal rule mining). 

Through in-class discussions, as well as hands-on exercises using Python and large-scale computing frameworks like Spark, students will develop the mastery necessary to conduct large-scale data mining research. By the courseâ€™s conclusion, students will synthesize their knowledge and skills into an original research project, geared toward publication in a relevant Computational Social Science journal or conference.

*Prerequisites: Should complete first-year CSS Computing Sequence (through MACS 10113/30113/30123) and at least one course in Machine Learning (e.g. MACS 10100/30100 or 23002/33002).*

*Instructor Consent Required: In order to obtain instructor consent to join the class, each student should complete this [google form](https://forms.gle/F3q16z1Pk7XHBdLk7), which requires to submit an abstract detailing the problem area they are interested in and how (in broad strokes) data mining methodologies might help them solve the problem. Also, how they are prepared to engage in the course (e.g., other courses, previous publications, projects).*


## Course Structure
This course is structured into several modules, or overarching thematic learning units, focused on teaching students fundamental data mining concepts applied in large-scale data, as well as giving them the opportunity to apply these concepts to Computational Social Science research problems. Students can access the readings, assignments, and resources for each of the class sessions within these modules on the [Canvas course site][canvas_url]. If students have any questions about the course content, they should post these questions in the Ed Discussion forum for the course, which they can access by clicking the "Ed Discussion" tab on the left side of the screen on the Canvas course site. To see an overall schedule and syllabus for the course, as well as access additional course-related files (which we will walk through in in-class activities), students should visit (and clone/fork) the GitHub Course Repository, available here.

During regular class hours, we will meet for a mixture of lecture, group activities, and in-class coding exercises related to the topic for the day. Attendance to the class sessions is mandatory and is an important component of the final course grade. Students should prepare for these classes by reading the assigned readings ahead of every session. All readings are available online and are linked in the course schedule below (and in the corresponding module on Canvas). 

In order to practice scalable computing skills and complete the course assignments, students will be given free access to UChicago's Midway Computing Cluster resource, [Midway3]([https://aws.amazon.com/](https://rcc-uchicago.github.io/user-guide/)) cloud computing resources. More information about accessing these resources will be provided to registered students in the first several weeks of the quarter.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Mine large datasets using PySpark and fundamental data mining techniques.
- Articulate the types of social and cultural research questions that the methods and data of data mining are best suited to answer the theoretical insights they are best positioned to produce.
- Produce new knowledge about the social or cultural world through large-scale data mining. This knowledge will be situated as an original contribution to Computational Social Science, grounding it in relevant social scientific theory, and novel computational methods. 
- You will present your work in the format of either:
  - An extended abstract for submission to IC2S2 
  - Or (for work that is more developed): A full conference paper for submission to a relevant conference for Social Data Mining (KDD, ICWSM, WebSci, WebConf, etc.)
